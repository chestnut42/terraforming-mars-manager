# Terraforming Mars Manager Open-source

Terraforming Mars Manager provides API to create and manage
player accounts for the [Terraforing Mars Open-source](https://github.com/terraforming-mars/terraforming-mars)
project. **It is not affiliated with FryxGames, Asmodee Digital or Steam in any way.**

## Why?

1. Accounts. Create an account and keep all your games saved in one place. No
need to write down all your links somewhere
2. **Push notifications**. This service is capable of sending push
notifications to mobile client (currently iOS only). If you like to
play Mars turn-by-turn during the day this is the application you need.
3. Elo rating. If you often play with your friends you can measure
who is the best Mars Terraformer

## Installation notes

None yet. In two words this service operates as a proxy to Terraforing Mars Open-source
service.

If you are interested in your own copy running feel free to create an issue
we'll figure something out.
